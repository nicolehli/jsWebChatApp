# jsWebChatApp
Simple chat application to learn web programming.

### <b>Getting Started</b>

First, we need to have the Node server running. 
<li> From command line, got to directory where you saved the files
<li> Run the command 'node server.js'

Second, we need the chat application
<li> from a browser, go to localhost:8080 
<li> from a second browser (or new tab in the first browser), we can bring up another http://localhost:8080
<li> now first browser can chat with the second browser through the chat application

Disclaimer: newcomers to the chat room cannot see previous messages
