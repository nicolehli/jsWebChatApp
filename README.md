# jsWebChatApp
Simple chat application to learn web programming.

### Getting Started

First, we need to have the Node server running. 
* From command line, got to directory where you saved the files
* Run the command 'node server.js'

Second, we need the chat application
* from a browser, go to ```localhost:8080 ```
* from a second browser (or new tab in the first browser), we can bring up another ```http://localhost:8080```
* now first browser can chat with the second browser through the chat application

*Disclaimer:* newcomers to the chat room cannot see previous messages

### Screenshot(s)
I'll add screenshots here later.
