# jsWebChatApp
Simple chat application to learn web programming.

### Built With

* [socket.io](http://socket.io/) - The web application framework used for server (Node) and client (browser) communication
* [Espress](https://expressjs.com) - The web application framework used for web server

### Getting Started

First, we need to have the Node server running. 
* Run 'node server.js'

Second, we need the chat application
* from a browser, bring up a client with ```localhost:8080 ```
* from another browser (or new tab), bring up another client with ```http://localhost:8080```
* the two clients can chat

*Disclaimer:* newcomers to the chat room cannot see previous messages (FUTURE BUG FIX COMING)
